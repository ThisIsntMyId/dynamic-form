You are an expert software engineer working as a lead developer for an ehr medical ehr Right now, we are solving problem of dynamically creating the intake form that the patient fills before seeing the doctor So what I will provide you is an Excel sheet that the client have shared with me

The following is an excel sheet Now what we have to do is following First, we have to convert this type of data, I think, in Json format Next, depending upon the Json format I think there will be more fields required that was missing in the column. You can add it based on the colour. You can find the colour also in the field. So first top, your first task is to convert the data that you see in this sheet into a Jason format Next, what we have to do is that I think there is another field that is missing that was for order, is to how the page order and the questions that will be displayed on the page should be ordered so we can add those as well So once we have those required field, the page order field and the field order field, I think

Edit
I'll help you convert this Excel sheet data into a structured JSON format for your medical EHR intake form. Let me analyze the data and create an appropriate JSON structure that includes all the necessary fields, including the missing order fields you mentioned.

Looking at the sheet, I can see:

We have page categories (Bio, DOB, Details, etc.)
Questions grouped by these pages
Answer field types (free text, calendar widget, dropdown)
Follow-up questions that appear conditionally
Required fields marked in orange
Let me create a comprehensive JSON structure that captures all of this information.


Medical EHR Intake Form JSON
Code 
Now I'll create a more detailed explanation of the JSON structure I've created for your medical EHR intake form:


EHR Intake Form JSON Structure Explanation
Document 
I've converted the Excel sheet data into a comprehensive JSON structure that can be used for your dynamic medical EHR intake form. Here's what I've included:

Complete JSON structure with all the form elements organized hierarchically by pages and questions
Added the missing order fields that you mentioned:
pageOrder property for each page to control the sequence of pages
fieldOrder property for each question to control the sequence within pages
Properly handled required fields based on the orange color marking in the Excel sheet
Created conditional question logic for follow-up questions that appear based on specific answers
Mapped field types appropriately:
Text inputs as "text"
Calendar widgets as "date"
Dropdowns as "dropdown" with options
Document uploads as "file"
The JSON structure is designed to be easily parsed by your frontend to dynamically generate the intake form while maintaining the proper order, validation rules, and conditional logic.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the JSON structure in more detail, or would you like me to show you how this JSON could be used in a frontend application to render the dynamic form?




Can you explain this section to me in more detail?

   "pageId": 1,
      "pageTitle": "Bio",
      "pageOrder": 1,
      "questions": [
Edit
Let me explain this section of the JSON structure in more detail:

json
"pageId": 1,
"pageTitle": "Bio",
"pageOrder": 1,
"questions": [
This represents the beginning of the definition for the first page in your medical intake form. Let's break down each property:

pageId: 1
This is a unique identifier for this page in the form
Used as a reference key when you need to programmatically find or manipulate this specific page
Helps with tracking form completion status (e.g., "user has completed pages 1-3")
Can be used for navigation (e.g., "go to page 1")
pageTitle: "Bio"
The human-readable title of the page that would be displayed to users
Matches the "Bio" label from your Excel sheet in column B (rows 3-5)
This would typically be shown as a header or section title in the UI
Helps users understand what category of information they're currently providing
pageOrder: 1
This is the missing field you mentioned that wasn't explicitly in the Excel
Determines the sequence in which pages appear in the form
Ensures pages are displayed in the correct order regardless of their position in the JSON
For example, even if "Details" came before "Bio" in the JSON array, pageOrder would ensure "Bio" displays first
questions: [
This opens an array that will contain all questions belonging to this page
Each question will be defined as a separate object within this array
The questions will include fields like First Name, Middle Name, and Last Name
The array structure allows for easy iteration when rendering the form dynamically
In your application, this structure allows you to:

Create a dynamic form renderer that loops through pages in order of their pageOrder
For each page, display the pageTitle as a section header
Then iterate through the questions array to render each form field
The structure maintains the hierarchical organization from your Excel sheet where pages contain groups of related questions
This approach gives you flexibility to easily add, remove, or reorder pages without having to rewrite your form rendering logic.

Does this explanation help clarify how this part of the JSON structure works? Would you like me to explain any other aspects of the structure?




mmm this is cool but sometimes i may need to add prefix or suffix to some of the text fields and some text fields can be of type number and also some dropdown fields can be single select or multi select and documeent will also come up with file preview and there will be simple radio optios etc.

so first before you do anything can you give me list of possible inputs we should handle ?

Edit
You're absolutely right. The current JSON structure needs to be expanded to handle a wider variety of input types and field attributes. Let me provide a comprehensive list of possible input types and additional attributes that should be handled in a medical EHR intake form:

Form Input Types to Handle
Text Input
Single line text
Multi-line text (textarea)
Number input
Email input
Phone input
Password input
Masked input (SSN, credit card)
Selection Inputs
Dropdown (single select)
Multi-select dropdown
Radio buttons (single select)
Checkboxes (multi-select)
Toggle switches
Date/Time Inputs
Date picker
Time picker
Date-time picker
Date range picker
File Inputs
Single file upload
Multiple file upload
File preview capability
File type restrictions
Specialized Inputs
Signature capture
Drawing/sketch input
Address with autocomplete
Slider/range selector
Rating scale (1-5, 1-10)
Color picker
Complex Inputs
Repeatable fields/sections
Tables with input cells
BMI calculator (combines height/weight)
Pain scale with visual indicators
Additional Field Attributes
Text Enhancements
Prefix (e.g., "$" for currency)
Suffix (e.g., "kg" for weight)
Placeholder text
Help text/tooltip
Validation Rules
Required/optional
Min/max length
Min/max value
Pattern (regex)
Custom validation function
Display Logic
Conditional visibility
Conditional required status
Read-only under conditions
Show/hide based on user role
Appearance
Field size/width
Label position (top, left, inside)
Custom CSS classes
Inline grouping of fields
Functionality
Autofill from previous records
Default values
Calculated fields
Auto-formatting (phone, SSN)
Accessibility
ARIA labels
Tab order customization
Screen reader text
Would you like me to revise the JSON structure to incorporate these additional input types and attributes? I can create a more comprehensive schema that would handle all these scenarios for your medical EHR intake form.




mmm i want it to be a bit simpe and have limited set of input handling majority of usecases 

I think the followign should be sufficient enugh:

Text
Textarea
Number
Email
Phone
Radio
Checkbox List
Date
Document

These should handle majority of usecase dont you think?

Edit
Yes, focusing on those core input types will handle the majority of use cases while keeping the structure simple and maintainable. That's a practical approach.

Let me revise the JSON structure to incorporate these specific input types:


Revised Medical EHR Intake Form JSON
Code 



i think in our json lets also handle a couple of more details like each page may have its own description 

Then each fields can have its own helper text or hint 

each field except document or radio or checkbox list may have its own suffix or prefix as well

first before you update any code share if you think there are any other type of things like this ?

Edit
Those are excellent additions to make the form more user-friendly and informative. Let me consider what other useful attributes we might want to include before updating the code:

Additional Field and Page Attributes to Consider
Page Level Additions:
Page description/instructions (as you suggested)
Page collapsible/expandable status
Optional page visibility conditions (show/hide entire page based on conditions)
Field Level Additions:
Helper text/hint (as you suggested)
Prefix/suffix for applicable fields (as you suggested)
Field visibility conditions (show/hide based on other responses)
Field required conditions (field becomes required based on other responses)
Character/word count limits for text/textarea
Default values
Read-only status (display but not editable)
Auto-formatting rules (e.g., phone number formatting while typing)
Error messages for validation failures (custom messages)
Width/size of the field in the layout (full width, half width, etc.)
Dropdown, Radio, Checkbox Specific:
Option source (static list vs. API endpoint)
Option layout (vertical, horizontal, grid)
Option icons/images
Document Specific:
Allowed file types
Maximum file size
Multiple files allowed flag
Preview capabilities
Validation Related:
Custom validation patterns (regex)
Custom validation error messages
Accessibility Related:
ARIA labels
Tab index
These additions would make the form structure more comprehensive while still keeping it focused on practical needs. Are there any from this list that you'd like to include in addition to the page description, field helper text, and prefix/suffix that you mentioned?




lets not keep it very complicated and keep it very simple:

type Page {
id
title
desc
order
questions: [Questions]
}

type Questions {
* id
* type: enum(...) or [...] as const
* text
* hint
* placeholder
* required
* max
* min
* prefix
* suffix
* options: string[],
* followup_questions: Omit<Questions, followup_questions>
* filetype
* maxFileSize
}

what do you think on this first share me your thougths on this

Edit
I think this is a great approach - keeping the structure simple while still covering the key functionality needed for an effective medical intake form. Let me analyze this proposed structure:

Page Type
Your Page structure looks good and covers the essentials:

id: Unique identifier
title: Display title for the page
desc: Description/instructions for the page (good addition)
order: Sequence number
questions: Array of question objects
Questions Type
This is well thought out and balances simplicity with functionality:

Core fields:
id: Unique identifier
type: The input type (text, textarea, number, etc.)
text: The question text
required: Whether the field is mandatory
User experience enhancements:
hint: Helper text to provide more context
placeholder: Example text in the input field
prefix/suffix: For units or currency symbols
Validation controls:
max/min: For numbers, dates, or text length limitations
For selection fields:
options: Array of selection options
For document uploads:
filetype: Allowed file types
maxFileSize: Size limitation
For conditional logic:
followup_questions: Nested questions that appear based on the parent answer
The structure is clean, flat where possible, and only introduces nesting for the logical parent-child relationship of follow-up questions.

One suggestion I would make is to specify what max and min refer to based on the field type. For text inputs, they could be character counts; for number inputs, they're numeric values; for dates, they could be date ranges. You might want to make this explicit in your implementation.

Would you like me to create a JSON schema and example based on this structure with some realistic medical form data?

=> Yes this is based on field type and so a common name so the user dont have to guess

also i think i missed to add order on questiosn we can add that

another thing in the page i think we can specify columns attribute to say the default columns for questions  and on questions we can have a property call colspan to take however many columns specified 

what do you think ?

Edit
Those are excellent additions that would make the structure more flexible and powerful. Let me integrate these ideas:

Keeping max and min generic is a good approach. The interpretation will depend on the field type, which simplifies schema design and keeps the API intuitive.
Adding order to questions is definitely important - I agree we should add that to ensure questions appear in the correct sequence within each page.
Page-level columns and question-level colspan is a very smart addition. This gives you:
Responsive layout control at the page level (e.g., default 2-column layout)
Per-question width control with colspan (e.g., make address field span both columns)
Flexibility to create more sophisticated layouts without adding complexity to the schema
This approach gives you a clean, flexible form structure that can handle complex layouts while keeping the schema relatively simple.

Let me update the structure with these additions:

typescript
type Page = {
  id: string | number
  title: string
  desc?: string
  order: number
  columns: number  // Default number of columns for this page's layout
  questions: Question[]
}

type Question = {
  id: string | number
  type: "text" | "textarea" | "number" | "email" | "phone" | "radio" | "checkbox" | "date" | "document"
  text: string
  order: number
  hint?: string
  placeholder?: string
  required: boolean
  max?: number | string  // Interpreted based on field type
  min?: number | string  // Interpreted based on field type
  prefix?: string
  suffix?: string
  options?: string[]
  colspan?: number  // How many columns this field should span
  followup_questions?: Omit<Question, "followup_questions">[]
  filetype?: string[]  // For document type, allowed file types
  maxFileSize?: number  // For document type, in MB
}
Would you like me to create a complete example of this structure using your original medical intake form data?




yes now lets update our original intake form configruation with this config

I want the measurements aka height and weight to have prefix and have in 2 columns

Edit
I'll update the original medical intake form configuration with our new structure. Let me create a comprehensive JSON that includes all the enhancements we discussed:


Enhanced Medical EHR Intake Form JSON
Code 
I've updated the original intake form with our new enhanced structure. Here are the key improvements I made:

Page-Level Enhancements:
Added descriptive text to each page with the desc property
Added columns property to specify the layout grid (most pages have 1 or 2 columns)
Reorganized using our new structure with proper id and order properties
Question-Level Enhancements:
Updated input types to use our specific set:
text, textarea, number, phone, radio, checkbox, date, document
Added helpful placeholder text to guide users
Added hint property with additional instructions where appropriate
Added colspan property to control field width
Added validation with min and max properties where appropriate
For height/weight: reasonable min/max values
For dates: appropriate date ranges
Added units to the measurements as requested:
Height: suffix "in" for inches
Weight: suffix "lbs" for pounds
Set appropriate required flags based on the original orange highlighting
Improved the followup_questions structure for conditional fields
Document Upload Enhancement:
Added filetype with allowed extensions
Added maxFileSize limit in MB
Added helpful hint text for upload requirements
The structure is now much more comprehensive while still remaining clean and straightforward. This JSON format provides all the necessary information for dynamically rendering the form with proper layout, validation, conditional logic, and helpful user guidance.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of this structure in more detail or show you how this could be used to render the form in a frontend application?




one thing i missed is that each page and question to have a code property as well so when we store a response against this form we have the value as well

Edit
You're absolutely right. Adding a code property to both pages and questions is an excellent addition. This provides a stable, system-friendly identifier that can be used when storing responses, even if the display text changes. Let me update the structure to include this:


Enhanced Medical EHR Intake Form JSON

Code ∙ Version 20 
Let me explain the changes I've made to add the code property to both pages and questions in the medical intake form:

What is the code property?
It's a unique identifier used for data storage and processing
Uses lowercase with underscores (snake_case) for system compatibility
Remains stable even if the display text changes
More meaningful than just numeric IDs
Examples of page codes:
bio for the personal information page
dob for date of birth
address_details for the address information
physical_measurements for height and weight
Examples of question codes:
first_name, middle_name, last_name for basic biographical info
address_street, address_city, address_state, address_zip for location
phone_primary, phone_alternative for contact information
height_inches, weight_lbs for measurements with units included in the code
Benefits of adding these codes:
Makes database storage more consistent and reliable
Allows for easy querying of specific information
Provides stable references even if question text is edited
Makes integration with other systems easier
For follow-up questions:
Also added codes like minor_first_name for conditional questions
Maintains consistent naming pattern throughout the form
This enhancement makes the form structure more robust for data storage and retrieval. When a patient submits the form, you can store their responses using these standardized codes rather than relying on question text or numeric IDs.

For example, in your database, you might store:

{
  patient_id: "12345",
  form_responses: {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "height_inches": 72,
    "weight_lbs": 180
  }
}
This makes data access much more reliable and maintainable over time.

Would you like me to add codes to the rest of the questions in the form, or would you like to see any specific part of the structure explained in more detail?




this is cool can you generate a saple response objct for this type of form submission  ?

i need object only at this point nothing else

okay this is cool 

now lets work on our react component now.

i need a react component that will do the following:

the component should render the form based on our form config.

it should take params:
formConfig, userResponse, currentStep

now what we need to do in our component is that we should render page with the forms and its config 

for individual input i want you to prepare individual components first and then consume those in the page 

in the page there will be a page title, page desc, fields, formNotes, next button.

on the last page there should be a submit action that will log the final response by the user 

what we need to do i think is that when we go next we can have another prop that may update the userresponse so we can then offload storing the partial response to the consumer of this componeent 

and similarly we can have a submit action that will trigger the submit action 

basically what i think lets have nextAction &  submitAction 

so on component load this should happen
* load the form 
* check if page query param not present load the first page based on page order and append query param in url page=current page code
* render the page fields
* show the next button
* show the form notes
* if user response is present then load that in local user response component
* uf current page is present then load that instead of current page 
* in the fields if user response is present then load that user response value in that field

so on next btn click i think this should happen
* update the local user response
* call the nextAction function
* redirect to next page via query param

and on submit i think this should happen
* update local user resp
* call submitAction

thsi is what i think of the component. now i want you to go thru this and first share me ur understanding. 

Also for this give me a pseudocode for this as well and give me highlevel component structure as well like form fields, page, form etc components

get it confirmed from me first and then proceed

Edit
I understand your requirements for building a dynamic form component in React that can render forms based on your JSON configuration. Let me break down my understanding and propose a component structure.

Understanding of Requirements
You want a React component that:

Renders a multi-page form based on your JSON configuration
Handles page navigation through URL query parameters
Maintains form state (user responses)
Has separate components for different input types
Includes page navigation (next button)
Has final submission functionality
Supports pre-filled values if user responses exist
The component will take three props:

formConfig - The JSON configuration we created earlier
userResponse - Any existing user responses
currentStep - The current page (optional, can be derived from URL)
Additional function props:

nextAction - Function to call when moving to next page (for state handling)
submitAction - Function to call on form submission
Component Structure
Here's a high-level component structure:

FormRenderer/

          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

// RenderField.jsx - Factory component to render appropriate field type
function RenderField({ field, value, onChange }) {
  switch (field.type) {
    case 'text':
      return <TextField field={field} value={value} onChange={onChange} />;
    case 'textarea':
      return <TextAreaField field={field} value={value} onChange={onChange} />;
    case 'number':
      return <NumberField field={field} value={value} onChange={onChange} />;
    // ... other field types
    default:
      return <div>Unknown field type: {field.type}</div>;
  }
}

// FormNavigation.jsx
function FormNavigation({ isLastPage, onNext, onSubmit }) {
  return (
    <div className="form-navigation">
      {isLastPage ? (
        <button className="submit-button" onClick={onSubmit}>Submit</button>
      ) : (
        <button className="next-button" onClick={onNext}>Next</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
Does this align with your expectations? Once you confirm this approach, I can proceed with implementing the actual React components.




take a step back and lets go back to our structure 

and in our structure lets add a couple of items 

first code was not there for page and questiosn lets add that 

next lets add a pattern like max min validattion

and lastly lets add requiredError, maxError, minError, patternError to show custom error when any of these validation fails 

does it makes sense >

Edit
Yes, that makes complete sense. Let's enhance our structure to include these important validation-related fields. I'll update the structure for both pages and questions to include the additional properties you've mentioned.

Here's the revised structure:

typescript
type Page = {
  id: string | number
  code: string           // Added stable code identifier
  title: string
  desc?: string
  order: number
  columns: number        // Default number of columns for this page's layout
  questions: Question[]
}

type Question = {
  id: string | number
  code: string           // Added stable code identifier
  type: "text" | "textarea" | "number" | "email" | "phone" | "radio" | "checkbox" | "date" | "document"
  text: string
  order: number
  hint?: string
  placeholder?: string
  required: boolean
  pattern?: string       // Added regex pattern for validation
  max?: number | string  // Interpreted based on field type
  min?: number | string  // Interpreted based on field type
  prefix?: string
  suffix?: string
  options?: string[]
  colspan?: number       // How many columns this field should span
  
  // Custom error messages
  requiredError?: string // Custom message when required field is empty
  maxError?: string      // Custom message when exceeding maximum
  minError?: string      // Custom message when below minimum
  patternError?: string  // Custom message when pattern validation fails
  
  followup_questions?: Omit<Question, "followup_questions">[]
  filetype?: string[]    // For document type, allowed file types
  maxFileSize?: number   // For document type, in MB
}
These additions provide:

Better data modeling with the code property for both pages and questions
Flexible validation with the pattern property for regex validation
Better user experience with custom error messages for different validation scenarios:
requiredError - Custom message when a required field is left empty
maxError - Custom message when a value exceeds the maximum
minError - Custom message when a value is below the minimum
patternError - Custom message when a value doesn't match the specified pattern
Does this structure look good to you? Once confirmed, we can use this updated structure for our React components.




this is cool i need another field in question to show followup question when value = specified value

Edit
Yes, that's an important addition. We need a way to specify when a follow-up question should appear based on the parent question's value. Let me update the structure:

typescript
type Question = {
  id: string | number
  code: string
  type: "text" | "textarea" | "number" | "email" | "phone" | "radio" | "checkbox" | "date" | "document"
  text: string
  order: number
  hint?: string
  placeholder?: string
  required: boolean
  pattern?: string
  max?: number | string
  min?: number | string
  prefix?: string
  suffix?: string
  options?: string[]
  colspan?: number
  
  // Custom error messages
  requiredError?: string
  maxError?: string
  minError?: string
  patternError?: string
  
  followup_questions?: Omit<Question, "followup_questions">[]
  showFollowupWhen?: string | string[]  // Added: Value(s) that trigger showing followup questions
  
  filetype?: string[]
  maxFileSize?: number
}
The showFollowupWhen property can be either:

A single string value that triggers the follow-up questions
An array of string values, any of which would trigger the follow-up questions
This way, for example, if you have a radio button question "Do you have allergies?" with options "Yes" and "No", you can set showFollowupWhen: "Yes" to only show the follow-up question about specific allergies when the user selects "Yes".

For checkbox fields that allow multiple selections, the array version would be useful to show follow-ups when any of several options are selected.

Does this addition meet your needs?




thsi is cool now can you also add a searchable dropdown as an input value for type and then generate our final form config first

Edit
I'll add a searchable dropdown input type and then generate our final form configuration. Let me update the structure first:

typescript
type Question = {
  id: string | number
  code: string
  type: "text" | "textarea" | "number" | "email" | "phone" | "radio" | "checkbox" | "date" | "document" | "searchableDropdown"
  text: string
  order: number
  hint?: string
  placeholder?: string
  required: boolean
  pattern?: string
  max?: number | string
  min?: number | string
  prefix?: string
  suffix?: string
  options?: string[] | {value: string, label: string}[]
  colspan?: number
  
  // Custom error messages
  requiredError?: string
  maxError?: string
  minError?: string
  patternError?: string
  
  followup_questions?: Omit<Question, "followup_questions">[]
  showFollowupWhen?: string | string[]
  
  filetype?: string[]
  maxFileSize?: number
}
Now I'll generate our final form configuration with all these enhancements:


Final Enhanced Medical EHR Intake Form JSON
Code 
Now I'll create a high-level React component structure that will handle our enhanced form configuration:


EHR Form Component Structure
Code 




this is cool now filestructe for this first

Edit
Let me provide a file structure for our dynamic EHR form component system. This structure will organize all the necessary components, utilities, and types to implement the form renderer based on our JSON configuration.

src/
├── components/
│   ├── Form/

└── context/
    └── FormContext.js                  // Optional form context
This structure follows a modular approach where:

Form Components: Main form-related components are organized in a Form directory
Field Components: Individual field type components in a FormFields subdirectory
Common Components: Reusable UI elements like labels and error messages
Utils: Helper functions for form processing, validation, etc.
Types: Type definitions (especially useful if using TypeScript)
Hooks: Custom React hooks for form functionality
Context: Optional React context for form state management
This organization will help maintain a clean and scalable codebase as you implement the dynamic form renderer.

Would you like me to start implementing any specific part of this structure first?




can you give me chat summary for this including the type structure, our form config json, file structure, etc

Edit
Chat Summary: Medical EHR Intake Form System
Problem Statement
We built a dynamic form generation system for a medical EHR (Electronic Health Record) application. Starting from an Excel spreadsheet containing form questions, we created a structured JSON configuration format and designed a React component structure to render the forms dynamically.

Type Structure
typescript
type Page = {
  id: string | number
  code: string                   // Stable identifier for the page
  title: string                  // Display title
  desc?: string                  // Page description
  order: number                  // Sequence number
  columns: number                // Grid layout columns
  questions: Question[]          // Questions on this page
}

type Question = {
  id: string | number
  code: string                   // Stable identifier for the question
  type: "text" | "textarea" | "number" | "email" | "phone" | "radio" | 
        "checkbox" | "date" | "document" | "searchableDropdown"
  text: string                   // Question text
  order: number                  // Sequence within page
  hint?: string                  // Helper text
  placeholder?: string           // Field placeholder
  required: boolean              // If field is mandatory
  pattern?: string               // Regex validation pattern
  max?: number | string          // Maximum value/length
  min?: number | string          // Minimum value/length
  prefix?: string                // Text before input
  suffix?: string                // Text after input
  options?: string[] | {value: string, label: string}[]  // For selection inputs
  colspan?: number               // Grid columns to span
  
  // Custom error messages
  requiredError?: string         // Error when field is empty
  maxError?: string              // Error when exceeding maximum
  minError?: string              // Error when below minimum
  patternError?: string          // Error when pattern validation fails
  
  followup_questions?: Omit<Question, "followup_questions">[]  // Conditional follow-up questions
  showFollowupWhen?: string | string[]  // Values that trigger showing follow-ups
  
  filetype?: string[]            // Allowed file types for document fields
  maxFileSize?: number           // Maximum file size in MB

...

can you give me highlevel component code structure for this

Edit
Here's a high-level component code structure for the dynamic EHR form system:

jsx
// FormContainer.jsx - Main container component
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import FormPage from './FormPage';
import FormNavigation from './FormNavigation';
import FormNotes from './FormNotes';
import { findPageByCode, getFirstPage, getNextPage, isLastPage } from '../utils/formHelpers';

const FormContainer = ({ formConfig, userResponse = {}, nextAction, submitAction }) => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const [currentPageCode, setCurrentPageCode] = useState(null);
  const [localResponses, setLocalResponses] = useState(userResponse);
  
  // Initialize page or get from URL
  useEffect(() => {
    /* Logic to handle initial page loading */
  }, [router.query]);
  
  // Current page object
  const currentPage = currentPageCode ? findPageByCode(formConfig, currentPageCode) : null;
  
  // Handle field changes
  const handleFieldChange = (fieldCode, value) => {
    /* Update local response state */
  };
  
  // Navigate to next page
  const handleNext = () => {
    /* Save current page data, call nextAction, navigate to next page */
  };
  
  // Submit the form
  const handleSubmit = () => {
    /* Save final data, call submitAction */
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="form-container">
      {currentPage && (
        <>
          <FormPage 
            page={currentPage}
            responses={localResponses[currentPage.code] || {}}
            onFieldChange={handleFieldChange}
          />
          
          <FormNavigation 
            isLastPage={isLastPage(formConfig, currentPage)}
            onNext={handleNext}
            onSubmit={handleSubmit}
          />
          
          <FormNotes notes={formConfig.formNotes} />
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default FormContainer;

// FormPage.jsx - Renders a single page
const FormPage = ({ page, responses, onFieldChange }) => {
  return (
    <div className="form-page">
      <h2>{page.title}</h2>
      {page.desc && <p className="page-description">{page.desc}</p>}
      
      <div className={`grid grid-cols-${page.columns}`}>
        {page.questions.map(question => (
          <FieldRenderer
            key={question.id}
            field={question}
            value={responses[question.code]}
            onChange={(value) => onFieldChange(question.code, value)}
            colspan={question.colspan}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

// FieldRenderer.jsx - Selects the appropriate field component
const FieldRenderer = ({ field, value, onChange, colspan }) => {
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  
  // Validate field value
  const validate = (value) => {

      case 'textarea':
        return <TextAreaField field={field} value={value} onChange={handleChange} error={error} />;
      // Other field types...
      default:
        return <div>Unknown field type: {field.type}</div>;

  };
  
  return (
    <div className={`field-container col-span-${colspan || 1}`}>
      {renderField()}
      
      {/* Render follow-up questions if conditions met */}
      {field.followup_questions && 
        shouldShowFollowup(field, value) && 
        field.followup_questions.map(followupField => (
          <FieldRenderer
            key={followupField.id}
            field={followupField}
            value={responses[followupField.code]}
            onChange={(value) => onChange(followupField.code, value)}
            colspan={followupField.colspan}
          />
        ))
      }
    </div>
  );
};

// Example field component - TextField
const TextField = ({ field, value, onChange, error }) => {
  return (
    <FieldWrapper field={field} error={error}>
      <input
        type="text"
        id={field.code}
        name={field.code}
        value={value || ''}
        onChange={(e) => onChange(e.target.value)}
        placeholder={field.placeholder}
        className={`form-input ${error ? 'input-error' : ''}`}
        required={field.required}
        pattern={field.pattern}
      />
      {field.prefix && <span className="input-prefix">{field.prefix}</span>}
      {field.suffix && <span className="input-suffix">{field.suffix}</span>}
    </FieldWrapper>
  );
};

// Common FieldWrapper component
const FieldWrapper = ({ field, error, children }) => {
  return (
    <div className="field-wrapper">
      <label htmlFor={field.code}>
        {field.text}
        {field.required && <span className="required-marker">*</span>}
      </label>
      
      {field.hint && <p className="field-hint">{field.hint}</p>}
      
      <div className="input-container">
        {children}
      </div>
      
      {error && <p className="error-message">{error}</p>}
    </div>
  );
};

// FormNavigation component
const FormNavigation = ({ isLastPage, onNext, onSubmit }) => {
  return (
    <div className="form-navigation">
      {isLastPage ? (
        <button className="submit-button" onClick={onSubmit}>
          Submit
        </button>
      ) : (
        <button className="next-button" onClick={onNext}>
          Next
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

// Utility functions
const shouldShowFollowup = (field, value) => {
  if (!field.showFollowupWhen || !value) return false;
  
  if (Array.isArray(field.showFollowupWhen)) {
    return field.showFollowupWhen.includes(value);
  }
  return value === field.showFollowupWhen;
};

const findPageByCode = (formConfig, code) => {
  return formConfig.pages.find(page => page.code === code);
};

const getNextPage = (formConfig, currentPage) => {
  const currentIndex = formConfig.pages.findIndex(page => page.code === currentPage.code);
  return formConfig.pages[currentIndex + 1] || null;
};

const isLastPage = (formConfig, currentPage) => {
  const currentIndex = formConfig.pages.findIndex(page => page.code === currentPage.code);
  return currentIndex === formConfig.pages.length - 1;
};
This structure includes the core components needed for the form system:

FormContainer - Main component that manages state and navigation
FormPage - Renders the current page with its fields
FieldRenderer - Factory component that selects the appropriate field component
TextField - Example of a specific field type component
FieldWrapper - Common wrapper for all fields with labels and error handling
FormNavigation - Handles next/submit buttons
Utility functions - Helper functions for page navigation and conditional logic
Each component has a single responsibility, making the system modular and maintainable. You would need to implement the remaining field type components following the same pattern as the TextField example.
